# Inspiration
Links to some projects that inspired me to start this project, check them out!

- [koblime - exporting highlights from kobo devices](https://kobli.me)
  - This program is pretty cool and helps keep track of highlights but offers little in the way of syncing to other platforms at the moment

- [Spotify Recently Played README](https://github.com/JeffreyCA/spotify-recently-played-readme)
  - Eventually I want to hook something up to my github profile to dynamically update it with a quote generated from HCQ
